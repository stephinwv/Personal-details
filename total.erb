
Well, <%=name%> <%=num1%>, <%=num2%>, and <%=num3%> are your favorite numbers!

I have to say, <%=name%>, you are interesting.

You are <%=age%> years of age, have <%=haircolor%> hair, and <%=eyecolor%> eyes.

Your choices are great, <%=fav_foods%> and <%=fav_drink%> cannot be beat!

You should play <%=num1%>, <%=num2%>, and <%=num3%> in the lottery! 
<%=total%> is the sum of your numbers, you should buy that many tickets!
